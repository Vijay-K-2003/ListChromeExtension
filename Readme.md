## Inspiration

Managing a Todo list outside chrome is boring so I created a chrome extension that I can edit as per my need.
## What it does

Stores List of Tasks. Any Task that needs attention can be put here. This enables user to Store the List of Tasks till the user has refreshed the Tab. 
## How we built it

Chrome API's like storage, and I used the Documentation + StackOverflow to solve the issues.
## Challenges I ran into

I had never made a chrome extension before. Using chrome.storage was confusing. 
I discovered that the Forms on submission reloads the tab, which caused to reset the list of tasks created by the user. This was corrected later.
## Accomplishments that I'm proud of

I made a chrome extension and I will try to build more.
## What we learned

Building a Chrome Extension
## What's next for List Chrome Extension

Editing the User Interface and resolving the logical errors in using the storage API.
## Built With
